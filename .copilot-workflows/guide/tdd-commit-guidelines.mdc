# TDD Commit Guidelines

Follow these guidelines to ensure that PRs adhere to the TDD cycle (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR) and that agents/collaborators include the bootstrap line in the description.

## Minimum Requirements
- Each TDD phase must have its own commit with a message beginning with one of these labels: `RED:`, `GREEN:`, `REFACTOR:` (e.g., `RED: fizzbuzz - test for 3 === 'fizz'`).
- The PR must include the bootstrap line in the description, for example: `Follow .copilot-workflows/AGENT_BOOTSTRAP.md and the TDD command tdd.md.`
- In the feature test file, add a TODO with a list of test cases ordered from simplest to most complex.

## Quick Example
- `RED: fizzbuzz - test for 3 === 'fizz'`
- `GREEN: fizzbuzz - implement minimal logic for 3 === 'fizz'`
- `REFACTOR: fizzbuzz - extract helper and improve naming`

## Why
- Facilitates small and traceable reviews.
- Enables automatic auditing (CI) to ensure TDD discipline across the team.

## Note
- This guide describes the recommended practice; automatic validation is performed using the `validate-tdd.yml` workflow in `.github/workflows/`.
